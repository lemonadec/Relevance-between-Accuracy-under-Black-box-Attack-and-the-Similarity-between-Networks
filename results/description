the figures result from:

1、maxmatch epsilon=xxx x
x^th block measured by maxmatch method with epsilon=xxx, where the block number can take teh value of 6,7,8
2、maxmatch x
x^th block measured by maxmatch method with epsilon=0.5(default value)
3、x y
x^th block measured by the y^th index (indices are in the same order as in the index file)
