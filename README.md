resnet.py: Implementation of standard Resnet-20 on CIFAR10 dataset.

model_training.py: running it to train Resnet-20 model. The model will be saved in \model

advattack.py: Implementation of PGD-40 adversarial attack. See [Madry, A., Makelov, A., Schmidt, L., Tsipras, D., & Vladu, A. (2017). Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks. ArXiv, abs/1706.06083.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)

similarity.py:Implementation of various similarity index(now only linear CKA). See [Kornblith, S., Norouzi, M., Lee, H., & Hinton, G.E. (2019). Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited. ICML.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414)
